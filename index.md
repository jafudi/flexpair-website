To give you an example: As a manager, you need to fill m project roles involving x cloud providers with n‚â†m data nerds who work from y locations in z (personal) time zones. You: üòµ‚Äçüí´ We: ü§ó Don't despair&mdash;flexpair!

With over 8 years of [data science experience](https://de.linkedin.com/in/fielenbach) under our belts, we understand that the success of these projects hinges on efficiently sharing work packages between coworkers before jointly delivering them to the client.

And as more and more companies transition to a hybrid working model, we asked ourselves the question: How can we make those frequent handovers more consistent and a truly hands-on experience?

## Truly interactive wherever you are
- easily switch back and forth between desktops
- share a cloud desktop for pair programming
- hear each other in high quality
- minimal bandwidth requirements
- zero install, fully runs in your favorite browser
- Receive a dedicated subdomain or bring your own

## Fully reproducible work environment
- the ability to clone not only the code but the entire shared desktop at the press of a button
- never hear "but it worked on my machine" ever again

## Scalable multi-cloud infrastructure
- Infrastructure-as-code powered by Terraform Cloud
- flexibly scale the number of project desktops and their compute power up and down

## Record and replay handover sessions


## Carbon dioxide and waste reduction
- Project members will have no need for a second or third notebook anymore. Not so fun fact: Did you know that the production of a notebook until you switch it on the first time produces as much CO2 as driving about 1200 km with your car?

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with lightweight LXQt desktop requires only 1 GB of RAM (often available for free)

## Inclusion through maximum flexibility
- actively supports synchronous and asynchronous work modes
- self-hosted team inbox [subdomain]@flexpair.com
- Made by neurodiverse people for neurodiverse people
- Inclusive of neurodiverse top talent
- flexible working time
- flexible work location

## Personal boundaries and privacy
- Flexpair deliberately does not offer video conferencing. Because remote work should not feel like being a lone wolf in one moment and like Big Brother in the next.

- if you really need to give someone remote access to your local machine, please consider using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) or comparable established solutions.

- full control over where your data are stored
- data privacy by locking out data collectors
