## Welcome to Flexpair

The success of data-driven projects hinges on efficiently sharing work packages between coworkers and jointly delivering them to the client.

With more and more companies transitioning into a hybrid work model, we asked ourselves the question: How can we make those frequent handovers more consistent and a truly hands-on experience? 

### Value Proposition

With our novel Flexpair solution, which you can test here for free, you will have
- the feeling of shoulder-to-shoulder pair programming, even when working remotely
- zero friction when you need external people to join your session ad hoc
- the ability to clone not only the code but the entire shared desktop at the press of a button
- no missing dependencies etc. ever again, even across different cloud providers
- the option to flexibly scale up (and down) your RAM and CPU cores
- minimal latency and bandwidth requirements
- no need for a second or third notebook

Not so fun fact: Did you know that the production of a notebook until you switch it on the first time produces as much CO2 as driving about 1200 km with your car?
