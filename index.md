Flexpair enables consistent, sustainable and inclusive **üìädata scienceüß™** across *any* kind of boundaries&mdash;except the ones you define.

To give an example: As a manager, you need to fill m project roles involving x cloud providers with n‚â†m data nerdsü§ì who work from y locations in z (personal) time zones. You: üòµ‚Äçüí´ We: ü§ó Don't despair!

With over 8 years of experience on data science focused consulting projects under our belts, we understand that the success of those projects hinges on efficiently sharing work packages between coworkers and jointly delivering them to the client.

## ‚úÖ Consistency

As more and more companies transition to a hybrid working model, we asked ourselves the question: How can we make those frequent handovers more consistent and a truly hands-on experience?

### Consistent across synch and asynch work modes

#### Through Flexibility

- easily switch back and forth between desktops
- share a cloud desktop for pair programming

#### Through Boundaries

- if you really need to give someone remote access to your local machine, please consider using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) or comparable established solutions.

- zero install, fully runs in your favorite browser (TLS certificate included)


### Consistent across multiple cloud providers

#### Through Flexibility

- Infrastructure-as-code powered by Terraform Cloud
- the ability to clone not only the code but the entire shared desktop at the press of a button

#### Through Boundaries

- full control over where your data are stored
- data privacy by locking out data collectors

## üå± Sustainability

### Sustainable for our planetary ecosystem

#### Through Flexibility

- flexibly scale the number of project desktops and their compute power up and down

#### Through Boundaries

- Project members will have no need for a second or third notebook anymore. Not so fun fact: Did you know that the production of a notebook until you switch it on the first time produces as much CO2 as driving about 1200 km with your car?

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with lightweight LXQt desktop requires only 1 GB of RAM (often available for free)

### Sustainable for your team's motivation

#### Through Flexibility

- hear each other in high quality
 
- Receive a dedicated subdomain or bring your own

- self-hosted team inbox [subdomain]@flexpair.com

#### Through Boundaries

- never hear "but it worked on my machine" ever again

## ü™¢ Inclusion

### Inclusive of neurodiverse top talent

Made by neurodiverse people for neurodiverse people.

#### Through Flexibility

- flexible working time
- flexible work location

#### Through Boundaries

- Flexpair deliberately does not offer video conferencing. Because remote work should not feel like being a lone wolf in one moment and like Big Brother in the next.

### Inclusive of worldwide top talent

Made by experienced data scientists for their fellow data nerds.

#### Through Flexibility

- open-source first approach

#### Through Boundaries

- minimal bandwidth requirements
