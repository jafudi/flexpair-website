Knowing a thing or two about data science ourselves, we understand that the success of data projects hinges on efficiently sharing work packages between coworkers and jointly delivering them to the client.

With more and more companies transitioning into a hybrid work model, we asked ourselves the question: How can we make those frequent handovers more consistent and a truly hands-on experience?

## Seamless transitions between synch and asynch

- share a cloud desktop for pair programming and hear each other
- automatically clone desktop even across cloud providers
- switch between each others desktops at the press of a button
- zero install, fully runs in your favorite browser
- Apache Guacamole for screen and Mumble for audio
- Receive a dedicated subdomain or bring your own
- self-hosted team inbox [subdomain]@flexpair.com

## Consistently reproducible work environment

- Infrastructure-as-code powered by Terraform Cloud
- the option to flexibly scale up (and down) your RAM and CPU cores
- the ability to clone not only the code but the entire shared desktop at the press of a button
- no missing dependencies etc. ever again, even across different cloud providers

## Taking privacy and data protection serious

- SSH encryption and TLS certificate for protecting your data
- full control over where your data are stored
- data privacy by locking out data collectors

## No contradiction: Save money and the planet

- Project members will have no need for a second or third notebook anymore. Not so fun fact: Did you know that the production of a notebook until you switch it on the first time produces as much CO2 as driving about 1200 km with your car?
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with lightweight LXQt desktop requires only 1 GB of RAM (often available for free)
- flexibly scale the number of project desktops and their compute power up and down
- minimal bandwidth requirements

 No surprise Flexpair simply rocks, being rock-solid <u>and</u> flexible in just the right places. Because it was tailor-made by experienced data scientists to be enjoyable for their fellow data nerds. Hence, it has all the features that your prospective high potentials value most, like
- **r**eproducibility
- **o**pen-source
- **c**lean interface
- **k**now where your data resides
- **s**calable compute power

## When Not to use Flexpair

If you really need to give someone remote access to your local machine, please consider using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) or comparable established solutions.

Also, Flexpair deliberately does not offer video conferencing.
