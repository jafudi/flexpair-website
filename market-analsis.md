# Market Analysis

According to a [press release from Gartner in July 2020](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-23-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-6point3-percent-in-2020) the market demand for cloud-based desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) will rise to 2.535 billion USD in 2022. This consitutes the Total Addressable Market (TAM) which is, of course, totally unrealistic to achieve with our product in the near future.

We deliberately chose to focus on Linux as our guest operating system for a variety of reasons that software developers in particular will immediately understand. In order to quantify the preference for UNIX-based operating systems over Windows, we analyzed the raw data from [Stack Overflow's 2020 user survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020) and found that 23.2% of professional developers are already using Linux as their primary desktop, 25.0% were on MacOS and 16.0% were Windows users explicitely stating that they would rather prefer to work on Linux. Extrapolating from the 64462 valid responses to the survey, we are confident to conclude that 64.3% of global pro-developers are affine to UNIX and would dislike being forced to use Windows on a virtual desktop.

But also people working in other sectors like education and media as well as finance value the security and stability of Linux. A whopping 16.9% of all Ubuntu users work in finance according to [21,291 survey responses in April 2020](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-04-survey-results). These verticals on top of IT add up to a little over 50% of the whole market according to [Marketysers Global Reports And Data](https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/desktop-virtualization-market). Considering that there are some Linux users in the other half of verticals as well, we consider a Servicable Adressable Market (SAM) of around 0.500 x 0,643 x TAM not as an overestimate. For the year 2022 this means we expect 815 million USD or 675 million EUR demand for LINUX-based DaaS solutions.

Finally, the Servicable Obtainable Market (SOM) is likely the small and medium size businesses (about 20% of the market), as the more established [competitors](https://www.g2.com/products/shells-com/competitors/alternatives) catering to large enterprises come with a hefty price tag.
