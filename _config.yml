title: We unite sync and async data science
description: "Imagine a distributed team of data nerds hacking on a complex project, and nobody ever says stuff like: <em>But it worked on my machineü§∑&hellip;</em>  With Flexpair, when you do a handover, you talk them through work packages on an interactive cloud desktop that has been replicated automatically, including all your custom dependencies. And before merging the feature branch, you visualize results togetherü§ù on real data&mdash;even across different cloud providers."
