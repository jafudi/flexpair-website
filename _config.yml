title: We unite sync and async data science
description: 'Imagine a team of data nerds hacking on a complex project, and nobody ever says: "But it worked on my machineü§∑". To good to be true? Not with Flexpair! Explain work packages and review merge requests togetherü§ù, on identical cloud desktops that recreate themselves at the push of a button, including all your custom dependencies. Enjoy true, immediate interaction, even when working on opposite sides of the globe and on different clouds.'
