title: We unite sync and async data science
description: 'Imagine a team of data nerds hacking on a complex project, and nobody ever: "But it worked on *my* machineü§∑". Sounds too good to be true? With Flexpair you can handover work packages and review merge requests togetherü§ù. On identical cloud desktops that recreate themselves at the push of a button with all your custom dependencies installed. Feel like being in one room, even when working on opposite sides of the globe and on different clouds.'
